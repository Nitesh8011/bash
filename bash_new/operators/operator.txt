scale for no od decimals 
bc to solve an arbitrary number of digits and can perform various arithmetic operations
echo "scale=3; (-105.5*7+50*3)/20 + (19^2)/7" | bc



for round and executing large arithmetic
#!/bin/bash
read number
rounded=$(printf "%.3f" $(echo "scale=4; $number/1" | bc))
echo $rounded
