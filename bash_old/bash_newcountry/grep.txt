1. Search for the given string in a single file
$ grep "this" demo_file

2. Checking for the given string in multiple files.
$ grep "this" demo_*

3. Case insensitive search using grep -i
$ grep -i "the" demo_file

4. Match regular expression in files
$ grep "lines.*empty" demo_file
This is a very powerful feature, if you can use use regular expression effectively. In the following example, it searches for all the pattern that starts with “lines” and 
ends with “empty” with anything in-between. i.e To search “lines[anything in-between]empty” in the demo_file.

Regex
-> ? The preceding item is optional and matched at most once.
-> * The preceding item will be matched zero or more times.
-> + The preceding item will be matched one or more times.
-> {n} The preceding item is matched exactly n times.
-> {n,} The preceding item is matched n or more times.
-> {,m} The preceding item is matched at most m times.
-> {n,m} The preceding item is matched at least n times, but not more than m times.

5. Checking for full words, not for sub-strings
$ grep -i "is" demo_file

6. Use w for exactly same string
$ grep -iw "is" demo_file

7. Highlighting the search using GREP_OPTIONS
$ export GREP_OPTIONS='--color=auto' GREP_COLOR='100;8'
$ grep this demo_file

8. Searching in all files recursively using grep -r
$ grep -r "ramesh" *

9. Invert match using grep -v
$ grep -v "go" demo_text
show all the line whihc doesn't contain "go"

10. display the lines which does not matches all the given pattern.
Exmaple-
        $ cat test-file.txt
        a
        b
        c
        d
        
        $ grep -v -e "a" -e "b" -e "c" test-file.txt
        d
       
11. Counting the number of matches using grep -c
$ grep -c "go" demo_text (how many line matched)
$ grep -v -c this demo_file (how many line not matched)

12. Display only the file names which matches the given pattern using grep -l
$ grep -l this demo_*

13. Show line number while displaying the output using grep -n
$ grep -n "go" demo_text
