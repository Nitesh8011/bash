Differnce between for, while and until

for loop - For loop is used when the number of iterations is already known
while loop - While loop is used when the number of iterations is already unknown
until loop - It will run until the condition become true, unlike while in which it will run until the condition is true.


Loop control

break - terminate the entire loop
continue - skip a iteration
