sort [OPTIONS] [FILE]

Here are some common options for the sort command:

-r: Sort in reverse order (i.e., descending instead of ascending).
-n: Sort numerically instead of alphabetically.
-k <column>: Sort by a specific column in a file, specified as a number starting from 1.
-u: Only output unique lines (i.e., remove duplicates).
-f: Ignore case when sorting.


This command tells sort to use tabs ($'\t') as the field separator
sort -rn -k2 -t$'\t' & sort  -nr -k2 -t $'|'
