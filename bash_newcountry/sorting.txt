sort [OPTIONS] [FILE]

Here are some common options for the sort command:

-r: Sort in reverse order (i.e., descending instead of ascending).
-n: Sort numerically instead of alphabetically.
-k <column>: Sort by a specific column in a file, specified as a number starting from 1.
-u: Only output unique lines (i.e., remove duplicates).
-f: Ignore case when sorting.


This command tells sort to use tabs ($'\t') as the field separator
sort -rn -k2 -t$'\t' & sort  -nr -k2 -t $'|'

#to show unique character
Uniq show all charcter once
-c count of unique 
-d to show duplicate 
-u to show unique 

Limit comparison only to the first N characters (using the -w option).
Avoid comparing the first N characters (using the -s option).
Ignore variations in case between lines (using the -i option).
Avoid comparing the first N fields (using the -f option).

#to make upper into lower and do vise versa for lower to upper
tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' < input.txt > output.txt
