1. Search for the given string in a single file
$ grep "this" demo_file

2. Checking for the given string in multiple files.
$ grep "this" demo_*

3. Case insensitive search using grep -i
$ grep -i "the" demo_file

4. Match regular expression in files
$ grep "lines.*empty" demo_file
This is a very powerful feature, if you can use use regular expression effectively. In the following example, it searches for all the pattern that starts with “lines” and 
ends with “empty” with anything in-between. i.e To search “lines[anything in-between]empty” in the demo_file.
